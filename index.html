                Hello, my name is Matilda Routard and I am a first-year Global BBA student in ESSEC Business school in Paris. I grew up between Russia and France and fluently speak these two languages as well as English. I am beginner in German and Spanish. I am interested
                in photography, travelling and E-marketing. I keep an amateur blog about my trips on Instragram where you can follow my travels.

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>
                Traveling is an inseparable part of my life. It began when I was not even 2 years old and it remains my biggest passion. I have visited almost 40 countries on the globe and keep planning new trips. I am happy to share my experience on my Instagram profile.

            <h2> Photography</h2>
            <p>
                I am interested in photography since tha age of 10 when I got my first camera. This passion lasts until now and I am constantly trying to improve my skills in shooting and editing. My main tools are my camera Canon 550D, editors: Photoshop and Lightroom
                classic as well as Snapseed on my phone.

            <h2>E-marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Recently, I got into E-marketing and started to learn about web-design and promotion on the Internet. I am currently following Le Wagon course about programming and previously, I completed a course about Landing Pages. I am on a short hand with Facebook
                and Instagram and can help you to boost your business.
